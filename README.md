## How to use

This extension can only be installed for all users due to its tight dependencies on internal functions.

I **HEAVILY** recommend installing SillyTaverns ["Chat TopBar"](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-TopInfoBar) Extension to mitigate the large amount of unimplemented features in its current state.

### Instructions:

1. In Your Extensions Settings, click `"Install Extension"`
2. Enter `https://github.com/SammCheese/SillyTavern-Discordia` into the text field

3. Press `Install for all users` (IMPORTANT)

On smaller displays, you can swipe right to open the Sidebar.
