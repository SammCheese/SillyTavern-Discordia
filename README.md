## How to use

I **HEAVILY** recommend installing SillyTaverns ["Chat TopBar"](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-TopInfoBar) Extension to mitigate the large amount of unimplemented features in its current state.

### Instructions:

1. In Your Extensions Settings, click `"Install Extension"`
2. Enter `https://github.com/SammCheese/SillyTavern-Discordia` into the text field

3. Press either `Install for all users` or `Install for me`

On smaller displays, you can swipe right to open the Sidebar.
